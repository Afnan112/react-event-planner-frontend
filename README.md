### Code I’m proud of

Code I’m proud of. This is the first code I wrote in the application, which creates a new event. I was able to use a single useState instead of eight separate useState.

### Challenges
- This was my first full-stack project, which required me to learn how to coordinate between the frontend (React) and the backend (Django). I faced challenges in task separation, understanding how data is exchanged between both sides, and managing state in React while effectively linking it to the API data.

#### IceBox Features
- Automatic reminders for attendees before the event via email or in-app notifications.
- A visual calendar to display events by date and allow users to easily browse and select upcoming events. 
- Allow users to share event links with others through social media or direct invite links
